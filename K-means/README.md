This program "K-means_business.py":

Imports necessary libraries

Reads the customer data from CSV

Asks the user to input the desired number of clusters

Preprocesses the data by selecting numerical columns and scaling them

Performs K-means clustering

Creates a visualization of the clusters using the first two numerical features

Prints a summary of how many customers are in each cluster


Note: Ensure you have installed the required libraries (pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib) and that your customer_data.csv file is in the same directory as the script. You can install them using:

pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib

Open up your terminal and browse the folder with the program files, then type as follows: 

python K-means_business.py

Also, this code assumes your CSV file contains numerical features. If you want to use specific columns for clustering or need to handle categorical data, you must modify the data preparation step accordingly.
